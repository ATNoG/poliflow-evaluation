# PoliFlow Evaluation

This repository holds the preliminary tests made for the PoliFlow Enforcer for the article "PoliFlow: Inferring Control-Flow Policies from Serverless Workflows."

The `invocation` directory has the script for the `Deployment time` and `Teardown time` tests, while the `latency` directory holds the ones for the `Latencies` evaluations (for the `Refund` and `Valve` applications, as well as the ones for the sequences of 70 functions (`long-sequence`) and of 70 parallel states (`long-parallel`)).
